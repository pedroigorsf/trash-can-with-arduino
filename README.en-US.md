## üíª About the project

This project presents an automated trash can using electronic components and Arduino control, aiming to facilitate the collection or direct contact with trash in hospital environments and also aiming at accessibility for the disabled.

In this context, the adaptation of a conventional trash can was carried out, so that it could respond by proximity through an ultrasonic distance sensor, and thus carry out the activation of the lid automatically through the activation of a servo motor, opening and closing the bin without the need to touch it and with the possibility of adjusting the minimum distance for activation and the time the bin will remain open through two potentiometers. A device that avoids physical contact between the user and the object is often useful, whether due to physical limitations, hygiene and among other reasons.

Thus, in order to solve this problem, an automated trash can provides the necessary means to open the lid without the need for physical contact. In addition to this application, it can also be used in hospital environments, aiming to avoid the contact of professionals with the trash, thus avoiding contamination or transmission of any type of bacteria or virus. The expected results with the prototype were satisfactory.

**Specific objectives**
- Develop an interactive electronic wastebasket;
- Accessibility for the disabled;
- Device that avoids the physical contact of the user.

## Theoretical References
An introduction will be given to some important issues for the basis of this work. Initially, the concept of the internet of things and its possible applications will be discussed and then the concept of the Arduino used will be described. Then, it will be shown the importance of a device that avoids physical contact, as well as the difficulties of a person with a physical disability.

**Internet of Things:**

When we come across the term Internet of Things, we usually see the acronym IoT associated. And it's pretty simple to understand why. Internet of Things is a translation of the English Internet of Things. Internet of Things is a way to make everyday items capable of collecting and transmitting data. The concept aims to provide computational power and interconnection to common everyday objects. Objects using the IoT become intelligent, using ubiquitous computing, communication technologies and sensor networks to perform specific activities. This allows information to be generated by these devices, which can be sent to servers so that people can access this data.
To be considered an intelligent object, that is, to be inserted in the context of the internet of things, the device must contain some characteristics. These characteristics are related to its functionalities and applications. The characteristics that objects can contain are:

- **Processing:** Responsible for computing power, performs control actions and decision making.
- **Identification:** Responsible for the individualization of each object, enabling the distinction between them.
- **Sensing:** It is the object's ability to perceive variations in environmental magnitudes and transform them into data.

This concept can be applied to application areas such as industry, health, safety, environment and cities.
**Arduino:**
Arduino is an open source hardware platform developed to promote interactions with the environment, in a simple way, through electronic devices, through programming. The circuit board of this platform has several types of inputs and outputs and a microcontroller that has a previously recorded bootloader software. This allows for a computer-friendly development environment, requiring a basic knowledge of electronics and programming on the part of the user. Its programming language, called Processing, is derived from the C/C++ language. Thus, it can use input data from several sensors in order to control several actuators for a given application. For example, you can connect different sensors such as temperature, light, sound, etc., in order to control different actuators such as LEDs, motors, displays, speakers, etc. There are several peripheral modules on the market that can be coupled together without the need for cable or wire connections. Given these characteristics, Arduino has become popular, being used in specific functions, such as telemetry, machine control, and in different automations. Another attraction is the low cost of the hardware, and the possibility of performing numerous recordings and the flexibility of this tool allows unlimited applications.

**Public Health: Devices and Physical Contact in Hospital Environments.**
Due to the covid 19 pandemic, we had drastic changes in the form of human coexistence in order to self-preservation. Faced with these new perspectives, human contact has become scarcer and with objects and electronic devices it would be no different. There was already a movement brought about by industry 4.0, but the pandemic has become a catalyst for this process, with the need in hospital, industry and leisure environments for devices that avoid contact and maintain a sanitized environment. Another point to be addressed is that people with physical disabilities are also benefited from products from industry 4.0 or IoT that automate physical and repetitive processes.

## üõ† Materials and Methods:

The automated trash can consists of adapting a conventional trash can, so that it could respond by proximity through an ultrasonic distance sensor, and thus perform the lid actuation automatically by means of a servo motor, opening and closing the recycle bin without the need to contact it.

     The present work uses the Arduino Pro Mini board. The device is based on the ATMEGA328P microcontroller. Your board can be powered with a voltage between 3.3V to 12V through the USB recording interface, or from a battery, or DC power supply. This model has 14 digital pins (external electrical connections) that are bidirectional and can be used as input or output, depending on the programming. Six of these pins can be used as PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) output, which allows controlling, for example, a servo motor. The board also has 6 analog ports that accept connecting sensors such as potentiometer, etc.

     The HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor, is a very common component in Arduino projects, and allows you to take readings from distances between 2 cm and 4 meters, with an accuracy of 3 mm. First, a 10¬µs pulse is sent, indicating the start of data transmission. After that, 40 KHz pulses are sent and the sensor then waits for the return (high/high level), to determine the distance between the sensor and the object, using the following equation: Distance = (Echo time at high level * speed of sound) /2.

     Servo motor is a type of position motor often used in model airplanes, carts and other small-scale radio-controlled vehicles and is also widely used in automation and robotics. For this reason, they are easy to find in the specialized radio-control market. A servo motor essentially consists of a direct current motor with a position control circuit attached. The MG995 servo motor does not make a complete turn on its axis, it has a range from 0 to 180 degrees on its axis. Three cables come out of the servo motor: black, red and white or yellow. The black and red cables are for power and the white or yellow is the control cable. Internally, for the servo motor to work, there is a control circuit that receives a signal and converts it into a position, causing the servo motor to be positioned at a certain angle.
For this project, the MG995 servo motor was used. It has an average cost of R$ 60.00.

The I2C Adapter Module was developed in order to simplify the LCD display connection to the microcontroller. For a 4-bit connection between the LCD display and the microcontroller, at least 16 cables are required, so if the microcontroller has few digital ports this can be a problem. With the I2C Adapter Module, only 2 communication cables are needed between the LCD display and the microcontroller.
For this work, a 16x2 LCD Display with I2C Adapter Module was used in conjunction with the Arduino Pro mMini to display the distance and activation time of the servo motor.

Potentiometers are used in equipment to allow changing the operating regime. For example, the volume potentiometer allows you to increase or decrease the sound intensity level, while the brightness potentiometer allows you to control the brightness of the images. In the project, two 1K ohm linear potentiometers were used, the idea came from Mateus who observed the operation of the same in a teacher's class and decided that it would be possible to control the distance and the time that the trashcan lid would be open through these potentiometers used in the project.

 ## üéØ Presentation and analysis of results
 
 After assembling the circuit designed in Figure 7, and loading the code described above, the prototype was finalized. And in this section presents the photo of the completed prototype. Figure 8 illustrates the prototype.
 
 <img alt="Lixeira" title="Lixeira" src="./imagens/lixeira.png" width="300px"><br/> Figure 8. Completed prototype
 
 This work focuses on the construction of the trash can prototype where thorough research was carried out on each component that would be part of the final product. The prototype is composed of a structure of a trash can that has an ultrasound sensor that when identifying approach opens the trash can lid, this is only possible thanks to an Arduino microcontroller that bridges the gap between the source code and the machine language of the prototype that receives data. from the ultrasound sensor and transmits data to the servo motor. Another point would be the use of potentiometers as a kind of distance and time control for seconds that the lid remains open.
 
First attempt was carried out prototyping on a breadboard where the circuit has a sensor and the other components connected to the arduino where the system is powered by a 12V source. That first attempt went well. The second attempt to build the architecture of the dump took place with soldering of electronic components as the team had no experience with soldering components, a ramp procedure was necessary for the team's learning, for this reason classes taught by Professor Aloisio Silva de Sousa were held to understand the team. Welding was a procedure that demanded a little more from the team, so an action was necessary to decide some members who would be 100% in the leadership of this activity, these were Mateus Sipauba and Jayron Castro who focused on understanding and assembling the components. Another point is that it was decided not to use a 12V source anymore, but 5V, because the first tests were not successful and some components were burned and needed to be replaced.

 ## üìà Performance and Limitations

The trash can showed efficiency but had some technical flaws but as it is a prototype we consider that it is normal the costs are relatively low for a large scale construction and the architecture allows for product updates in the future.
